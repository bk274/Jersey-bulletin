                        that my work will help the people of New Jersey to get information needed to get up and running.

                    This box will include answer to how have you made it?
                    As a team, we made this application using skills and newer technologies learned in the class
                    as part of our CS curriculum. In the back-end, we used popular programming language Python
                    and its light-weight framework Flask to get up and running. In the front-end, we used another
                    popular programming language Javascript and its library called React. To store your comments 
                    and be able to retain them for later use, we used postgresql a relational database management
                    system. We used popular techology called git and github to let our team work on their part of
                    the application on their own and still be able to collaborate successfully with other team
                    members on this successful application for the people of New Jersey. To allow our fellow
                    citizens to take advantage of our informative site, we deployed this on one of the most popular
                    web hosting platform called Heroku.

                    To allow for easy access to information related to New Jersey, all while building a sense
                    of community within residents.
